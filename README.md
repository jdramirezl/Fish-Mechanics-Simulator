# Fish-Mechanics-Simulator
For my physics class we needed to investigate about the physics involved in how fish jump. To further improve my exposition I created this simulator in Python, where you can see different important data of the fish, such as the Y and X velocity vectors, the velocity magnitude, acceleration, the approximate jump of the fish (Where the program thinks its gonna land), etc.

You can play it with the WASD keys.
